    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>My name is Adam. I'm a writer, editor and aspiring developer.</p>
    <p>I live in Toronto but my heart is in beautiful Cape Breton Island/Unama'ki, Nova Scotia.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website; I built it myself, so please excuse the simplicity.</p>
    <p>I've spent <span>more than a decade</span> in the journalism industry, working for the national public broadcaster, a mid-market newstalk radio station and now a national news agency.</p>
    <p>I've worked in newsrooms large and small, from Thunder Bay to Toronto to Halifax. My primary focus has been on audio storytelling -- using natural sound, interviews, music and my own voice to bring the news to life on the radio.</p>
    <p>Here are a few of the things I've worked on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A no-code application that allows reporters to record cellphone interviews</li>
        <li>A Slackbot that helps newscasters pronounce unfamiliar terms</li>
        <li>An in-house glossary to onboard new hires</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're looking to get in touch, you can email me at torontocaper@gmail.com.</p>
    <p>I'm also on Twitter, LinkedIn and Discord.</p>
